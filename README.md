An International logistics company is looking towards making their deliveries more agile and high speed
and to achieve this, they wanted to drive their application lifecycle management through their devops
initiatives. With hundreds of developers working across remote locations in different timezones and their

market agility and win more customers. Git transformed how they used to code and that helped them
manage their ALM better.
